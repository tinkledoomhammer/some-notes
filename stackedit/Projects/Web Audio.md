# Web Audio Api

[Getting Started](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API/Using_Web_Audio_API) on MDN

[An example](https://medium.com/swinginc/playing-with-midi-in-javascript-b6999f2913c3) using oscillators.

[Web Audio](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) on MDN

[A web midi wrapper/helper library](https://github.com/djipco/webmidi)
* It contains functions for decoding messages and converting between note values and frequencies.

[A software midi device for playback](https://coolsoft.altervista.org/en/virtualmidisynth)
* Tiny installer, user-mode drivers
* Requires [sound font files](https://coolsoft.altervista.org/en/virtualmidisynth#soundfonts)
* These archives need to be [decompressed.](https://woolyss.com/chipmusic-soundfonts.php#compressors)
* It still won't show up in requestMIDIAccess :<
* Perhaps I am reading those results wrong. Should try iterating over them.
* It shows up after restarting chrome.

Why won't "Microsoft wavetable GS synth" show up in the lists? I now have a second one installed as well. Only the new one is available to webmidi.

[This project, "webaudiofont"](https://surikov.github.io/webaudiofont/) seems to work!


Some similar software at <http://jdmcox.com/>

[This](https://github.com/oldrich-s/musicope) is a web app that has a lot of what I want to accomplish. 


## Basic components of the music app
Emuating software that is commonly built into keyboards:
* Display of musical notation 
* Highlighting piano keys
* Accompaniments, auto-chords, styles
* Selecting instruments
* Recording and playback
* Tutorial modes

I should try different software packages before deciding on functionality. Unfortunately it does not appear that there is free software to do what I want, but the market of freemium and commercial software is overwhelming.
