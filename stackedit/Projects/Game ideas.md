## Really basic games for practice

### Tower defense
* Need enemies



### Tactical combat


### State.io style rtt

### Turn-based RPG

## A good system for balancing and type management

* Exported resources get deleted when variable names change
	* Import/export from file? like a spreadsheet?
	* Put all of the unit data in a single autoload, json style but in gdscript?
		* Can't have constants with custom types. Perhaps there is a way with GDExtension, otherwise 
### Spreadsheet -> resource
* Spread sheets 
* exported to csv or something
* a toolscript that 
	* parses and validates the data
	* saves it as a resource
	* produces one or more .gd files with constants
* Perhaps something better than spreadsheets. to more easily maintain integrity
