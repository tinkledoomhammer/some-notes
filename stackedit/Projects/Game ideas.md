* Need enemies
* A good system for balancing and type management
	* Exported resources get deleted when variable names change
	* Import/export from file? like a spreadsheet?
	* Put all of the unit data in a single autoload, json style but in gdscript?
		* Can't have constants with custom types. Perhaps there is a way with GDExtension, otherwise 
	* Seems like the solution needs to be
		* Spread sheets 
		* exported to csv or something
		* a toolscript that 
			* parses and validates the data
			* saves it as a resource
			* produces


### Tactical combat


### State.io style rtt
