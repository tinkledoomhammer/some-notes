## Sewing Awls

* There should be a grove on one side of the needle. That is the front edge. The loop should form on the opposite side.
* Start by pushing the threaded awl through and pulling the end of the thread through.
* The free end on the back should be 20-30% longer than the total length of the stitch.
* For each loop of  stitch, 
	* Press the threaded awl through.
	* Retract part way to create a loop
	* Pass the free end through the loop
	* pull the awl the rest of the way back
	* tighten so that the knot is inside the fabric


* At the end, do the final loop as normal, but then stitch backward about 2 loops to secure the end.

## Saddle Stitch
* Uses 2 needles, 1 thread
* https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=A4RVr-wsirY
	* compares saddle stitch to machine stitch, demonstrates saddle stitch
	* Thread should be about 5x the total length of the stitch
	* uses slotted holes
	* 
 

## Bar Tack
* Can be done by hand
	* Create 3 loops the length of the entire stitch
	* Then sew tight stitches across the width of the three loops
	* A T can be created at either end to start/end the stitch
		* It is done the same, but perhaps smaller (i.e. 2 inner loops)
* With a machine
	* No need to do the inner loops first
	* Can be done in a zig-zag pattern.
		* Do multiple layers in alternating directions, filling in the gaps

## Box X
* Mark out a box where the stitch will go, about 1/8" from the edge
* Do the perimeter of the box first, optionally going back over the first side a second time
* Then do one diagonal, go back over one side, and do the other diagonal
* Corners a,b,c,d (a and c are diagonal), start with a->b->c->d->a then
	* (d->)a->b->d->c->a
	* or (d->)a->c->a->d->b->a

## Needle types
Universal
: somewhat rounded

Ball-point
: More rounded, break fewer threads

Stretch
: For sewing extra stretchy materials and lycra

Quilting
: Extra Strong

Leather needles
: sharp cutting point

Jersey
: Similar to ball/stretch

Topstitch
: have a larger eye for thicker thread

Microtex / Sharps
: Like universal but stronger and sharper for densely woven material and thin vinyl
