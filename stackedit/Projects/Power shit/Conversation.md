yah man, true

i got a few cases of new lithiums i'm tryin' to sell, betty got thrown off freebie cali insurance RIP

always somethin'

i just won this for 20$ on ebay

Me:
Sweet. What are your plans for it?

[Ryan:](https://www.facebook.com/dokmartini)


if i get the toolchain up i'm thinking about having some pcb's made p much cloning the 3 replicated carrier boards

they stack to 51 controllers of 5 cells per

i loaded the gerber file up on one site and alllmost clicked go lol

Ben:
Aha. Does it have free software suitable for everyday use in high voltage setups?

[Ryan](https://www.facebook.com/dokmartini)
well, yeah

actually

i'm also looking at going balls to the wall with a hypermodern TI refrence design for a DC to DC converter

some big honkin' bidirectional converters would really hit the spot rn

i realized they use mppt just like in a solar controller because ofc

Me:
Which converters are you looking at?

[Ryan](https://www.facebook.com/dokmartini)

starting with comical overkill

something to step down that 600-700vdc fast charge into something i can attain

lol

[https://www.ti.com/tool/TIDM-HV-1PH-DCAC] is lookin' pretty hot

[Ryan:](https://www.facebook.com/dokmartini)

i'm still lookin' for the converter that'll work as an arbitrary battery charger, directed in charging profiles by the protection board i slap on arbitrary batteries

(https://www.ti.com/tool/TIDA-00717#0) if i don't do stacking

maybe this other one

also look at this fucking behemoth

[https://www.ti.com/tool/PMP8740]

btw i'd like 5 of these plz

TIDA-00120 Solar MPPT Charge Controller Reference Design | TI.com

This design is a 20A Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) solar charge controller created for solar panel inputs corresponding to 12V and 24V panels.

Imma have to do some reading on those. The only mppt I have read up on have ac outputs for pannels spread over a wide area. Can they charge lead acid batteries directly or is the output programmable or something

Ryan:
ha i'd be using those to step my 36v system to a 12v rail prob

but yah

i really want a (multichannel?) dc to dc that can target arbitrary voltages between 3s and like 20s (lol 12s is fine)

it's totally a thing that can string together

so a big pile of different batteries can get charged systemantically based on SoC info and available energy through an mppt reading

lol this thing is magic
