## HOW TO COOK FROZEN CHICKEN BREASTS IN THE INSTANT POT
1. Make sure that your chicken breasts are not frozen together in one large mass. If they are, they will not cook evenly and you will end up with overcooked chicken on the edges and raw chicken in the center. To separate chicken breasts that are frozen together, place them in cool water until the chicken is thawed enough to separate the individual breasts. I always try to freeze my chicken flat in a zip-top bag so that the breasts do not stick together as they freeze.

2. Place the frozen chicken breasts in the bottom of the Instant Pot inner pot.

3. Pour in 1 cup of chicken broth. You can use water, but using chicken broth produces more flavorful cooked chicken.

4. Season the chicken as desired. Salt, pepper, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, dried oregano and paprika are all good choices for seasoning. Sprinkle the seasoning over the top of the chicken.

5. Place the lid on the Instant Pot and close it. Turn the steam release valve to the “sealing” position.

6. Press the “Manual” or “Pressure Cook” button and cook at high pressure. Use the +/- buttons to set the cook time. See below for my guide on how long to cook frozen chicken in the Instant Pot. The cook time will vary based on the size of the individual pieces of chicken.

7. After 10 seconds the Instant Pot will start automatically. It will take about 10 minutes to reach pressure and then the cook time will begin counting down.

8. When the cook time is finished, the Instant Pot will beep a few times. Allow the pressure to release naturally for 10 minutes, by leaving the Instant Pot alone. When the display reads L0:10 it has been 10 minutes since the cook cycle ended. Carefully turn the steam release valve to the venting position to release any remaining steam and pressure. Check that the float valve (pin) has dropped down and then carefully open the Instant Pot lid.

9. Use an instant read thermometer to check that the internal temperature of the chicken is at least 165 degrees F. If it is not, see the section below: What to do if chicken is not cooked.

10. Let the chicken rest for 5 minutes before slicing or shredding. The rest time allows the juices to redistribute throughout the chicken so that your chicken is moist.


#### INSTANT POT COOKING TIMES FOR FROZEN BONELESS, SKINLESS CHICKEN BREASTS

-   small (6-8 ounce) frozen chicken breasts – cook 11-12 minutes at high pressure, plus 10 minutes natural release
-   medium (9-10 ounce) frozen chicken breasts – cook 13-14 minutes at high pressure, plus 10 minutes natural release
-   large (12 ounce) frozen chicken breasts – cook 16 minutes at high pressure, plus 10 minutes natural release

It is always good practice to use an instant read thermometer to check that the internal temperature of the thickest part of the chicken has reached a safe 165 degrees F.

### WHAT TO DO IF YOUR CHICKEN IS NOT COOKED?

If your chicken is less than 165 degrees F when you check it after cooking, cook it for another 1-2 minutes at high pressure. The Instant Pot will come to pressure much more quickly the second time since it is already hot. Remember to close the lid and turn the steam release valve to the sealing position.

## HOW DO YOU COOK FRESH CHICKEN BREASTS IN THE INSTANT POT?

If your chicken is not frozen, you will use the same cook times and method described above. The only difference is that you will do a quick pressure release instead of a 10 minute natural release. The quick pressure release will stop the cooking process faster than a natural release.
