#### Idealism and Materialism
##### The Illusions of German Ideology


* >German criticism has, right up to its latest efforts, never quitted the realm of philosophy. 
  >Far from examining its general philosophic premises, the whole body of its inquiries has actually sprung from the soil of a definite philosophical system, that of Hegel.


 
* >Not only in their answers but in their very questions there was a mystification. 
>This dependence on Hegel is the reason why not one of these modern critics has even attempted a comprehensive criticism of the Hegelian system, however much each professes to have advanced beyond Hegel.

* >The entire body of German philosophical criticism from Strauss to Stirner is confined to criticism of religious conceptions... The dominance of religion was taken for granted.
>The Young Hegelians criticised everything by attributing to it religious conceptions or by pronouncing it a theological matter. The Young Hegelians are in agreement with the Old Hegelians in their belief in the rule of religion, of concepts, of a universal principle in the existing world. Only, the one party attacks this dominion as usurpation. while the other extols it as legitimate.



* >Since the Young Hegelians consider conceptions, thoughts, ideas, in fact all the products of consciousness, to which they attribute an independent existence, as the real chains of men (just as the Old Hegelians declared them the true bonds of human society) it is evident that the Young Hegelians have to fight only against these illusions of consciousness.
>Since, according to their fantasy, the relationships of men, all their doings, their chains and their limitations are products of their consciousness, the Young Hegelians logically put to men the moral postulate of exchanging their present consciousness for human, critical or egoistic consciousness, and thus of removing their limitations.
>The only results which this philosophic criticism could achieve were a few (and at that thoroughly one-sided) elucidations of Christianity from the point of view of religious history; all the rest of their assertions are only further embellishments of their claim to have furnished, in these unimportant elucidations, discoveries of universal importance.

* >It has not occurred to any one of these philosophers to inquire into the connection of German philosophy with German reality, the relation of their criticism to their own material surroundings.


##### First Premises of Materialist Method
>The premises from which we begin are not arbitrary ones, not dogmas, but real premises from which abstraction can only be made in the imagination. 
>They are the real individuals, their activity and the material conditions under which they live, both those which they find already existing and those produced by their activity. 
>These premises can thus be verified in a purely empirical way.


1. 
	>The existence of living human individuals. 
	>Thus the first fact to be established is the physical organisation of these individuals and their consequent relation to the rest of nature.

	* "Men can be distinguished from animals by consciousness, by religion or anything else you like. "
	* "They themselves begin to distinguish themselves from animals as soon as they begin to produce their means of subsistence, a step which is conditioned by their physical organisation."
