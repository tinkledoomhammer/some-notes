## Introduction

### Page 11 is just well poisoning.
Motives are attributed to vaguely specified individuals and poorly defined groups without any evidence. "Scientific education as we know it today has precisely this aim."

At the end of page 11, The question "But is it desirable to support such a tradition to the exclusion of everything else." Shows a very deep misunderstanding of science. "so that any result that has been obtained by other methods is at once ruled out of court?" would be blatantly unscientific. No one who understands science believes that the ideology leading to a theory has any bearing on the validity or usefulness of the theory. No one who understands science would disagree. The scientific approach to a "result that has been obtained by other methods" is to test it and determine whether it is actually true.

## Chapter 1

"The idea of a method that contains firm, unchanging, and absolutely binding principles for conducting the business of science meets considerable difficulty when confronted with the results of historical research."
Indeed, especially when that method is conceptualized in a way that contradicts actual science.  He doesn't seem to be making any distinction between the method in general and specific scientific conclusions. 

Then he makes a lot of unspecific claims about alternatives to these supposedly rigid "methodological rules." 

### The footnote on page 15 
demonstrates this perfectly. Bohr was an exemplary scientist. His work habits were a bit unorthodox but his methodology and his publications were not. 

"Both the achievements and the problems were produced in a way very different from the ways of those who want to subject everything to the tyranny of'logic'." 
The above shows that the author is projecting. He is imposing some limit on how scientists are supposed to think which scientists clearly do not impose on themselves.  It sounds like he is trying to apply the academic rigor of philosophy to science.

Here he starts talking about Galileo.

* 1514 -- The initial appearance of the heliocentric theory of Nicholas Copernicus (1473-1543) is associated with the private circulation of a manuscript known as the _Commentariolus_ (The Little Commentary) which was published many years later.
* 1517 (from another source) Martin Luther's 95 Thesis
* 1551 -- Deriving his results from Copernicus' data and planetary models, the German astronomer Erasmus Reinhold (1511-1553) publishes his _Prutenic Tables_, which for many astronomers replaced the outdated efforts associated with the Alphonsine Tables (1252). Reinhold's efforts were not seriously challenged until Kepler Rudolphine Tables, which were based on Tycho's data and Kepler's new calculation methods.
* 1564 -- Galileo Galilei born at Pisa, Italy, February 16; Michelangelo Buonarroti dies at Florence, 18 February; William Shakespeare born in England, 23 April.
* 1576 -- An early account of Copernicus's heliocentric theory, and a description of the cosmos and distribution of the stars as infinitely extended, is offered by the Englishman Thomas Digges (c.1546-1595)
* 1600 -- Giordano Bruno (1548-1600), an early Copernican, albeit philosophical and religious rather than technical, Bruno also argued form an infinite universe and a plurality of worlds. He was burned at the stake in Rome for his heretical opinions.
* 1604  -- In optics, Johannes Kepler publishes his  _Ad vitellioem paralipomena quibus astronomiae pars optica traditor_  (_The Optical Part of Astronomy_) where he argues that light rays are rectilinear, that they diminish in intensity by the inverse square of their distance as they travel from the light source. Kepler also argues that the retina is the seat of vision, and it is there that a 'pictura' is formed, an inverted image that is somehow transmitted to the 'seat of judgment'.

* 1607  -- Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) demonstrates that a projectile follows a parabolic path.

* 1608  -- The telescope (sometime translated as 'spyglass') is invented in the Netherlands; it employs a convex objective lens and a concave eyepiece.

* 1609  -- Galileo Galilei constructs his first telescope and turns it toward the heavens; his instruments begin at magnifications of approximately 3X and 10X, the most powerful achieving a magnification of 30X, an instrument he eventually gave away as a gift.

* Johannes Kepler's (1571-1630)  _Astronomia nova_  (_New Astronomy_) shows that Mars moves non-uniformly in an elliptical path and proposes a quasi-magnetic power or virtue emanating from the sun (a curious bi-polar magnet) as partial explanation for the planetary motions.

* Thomas Harriot in England independently obtains or builds a telescope and begins to observe the heavens; Harriot eventually makes drawings of the heavenly bodies, most notably the moon.

* 1610  -- In his highly influential  _Sidereal Messenger_, Galileo Galilei publishes his telescopic findings with subtle Copernican twists. Among his observations, Galileo argues there are innumerable stars invisible to the naked eye, mountains on the Moon (which he eventually measures), and four moons circling Jupiter. These observations were made for the most part in 1609; later in 1610 Galileo observes the phases of Venus, which suggested to him that waning and waxing planet must circle the Sun. Further, Galileo noted that Saturn appeared to have 'handles' (anses) and troubled over what could give rise to such an appearance; Huygens would later propose a brilliant hypothesis which served as one of the most subtle arguments for the motion of earth.

* 1611  -- Johannes Kepler's  _Dioptrics_  analyzes optical refraction and proposes a practical means to improve the Galilean telescope.

* 1612  -- Simon Marius (b. 1573) mentions for the first time (in modern Europe) the Andromeda galaxy, now known as M31. As Ismaël Boulliau later noted (1667) the galactic cloud had been observed centuries before by Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi.

* 1613  -- In his  _Letters on Sunspots_  Galileo took exception with the views presented by the Jesuit astronomer, Christopher Scheiner (1573-1650). Here Galileo appears clearly in the Copernican camp and also provides an early formulation for the principle of inertia.

* 1614  -- In mathematics, John Napier (1550-1617) in his  _Mirifici logarithmorum canonis descripto_  (_Description of the Wonderful Principle of Logarithms_) establishes rules for logarithms and supplies useful tables.

* 1616  -- The year of the infamous Injunction against Galileo, the famous Italian astronomer is warned by the Inquisition not to hold or defend the hypothesis asserted in Copernicus'  _On the Revolutions_, though it has been debated whether he was admonished not to 'teach in any way' the heliocentric theory. This work was in turn placed on the Index of Prohibited Books until corrected.

* 1618  -- A famous 'controversy on comets' erupted in this year involving Galileo and prominent Jesuit astronomers.

* 1619  -- Johannes Kepler's  _Harmonice mundi_  (_Harmonies of the World_) presents his so-called 'Third Law' which draws attention to the relationship between the annual periods of the planets and their mean distances from the sun.

* 1620  -- The English attorney and advocate of the 'New Science', Francis Bacon (1561-1626) published his justly famous  _Novum organum_, which sought to establish a method based on observation and experiment in opposition to Aristotle (who wrote the 'original'  _Organon_).
* 1627 -- Johannes Kepler's _Rudolphine Tables_, based on Tycho's data and his own laws of planetary motion, provide the most accurate astronomical tables up to that time.
* 1631  -- Pierre Gassendi, familiar with Kepler's astronomical tables, becomes the first to observe a transit of the planet Mercury across the disc of the sun. His data for Mercury were used by Boulliau in his  _Astronomia Philolaïca_  (Paris 1645).

* 1632  -- In one of the major publications of the century, Galileo's  _Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems, Ptolemaic and Copernican_  argues for a Copernican system; Galileo uses every tactic available to him, drawing on his telescopic findings, his new view of motion, and not a little rhetorical skill.

* 1633  -- Galileo is called before the Inquisition in Rome; he is vehemently suspected of heresy for supporting and teaching the Copernicanism hypothesis. After he abjured, Galileo was placed under house arrest for the remainder of his life, his visitors, his mail, and his daily actions were monitored. While the  _Dialogue on the Two Chief World Systems_  was placed on the Index of Prohibited Books, Galileo lived to see it translated into Latin, for a larger European audience, and he also saw his second major work, the  _Discours on the Two New Science_  published (Leiden, 1638).

>To speak more abstractly: consider a theory T' that successfully describes the situation inside domain D'. T' agrees with a finite number of observations (let their class be F) and it agrees with these observations inside a margin M of error. Any alternative that contradicts T' outside F and inside M is supported by exactly the same observations and is therefore acceptable if T' was acceptable (I shall assume that F are the only observations made).


Here the author is projecting his own unscientific attitude onto science itself.  Scientifically, `D'` is defined by `F` and `M` and not by `T'`.  Any other definition of `D'` is not supported by evidence. Therefore there is no contradiction between Galileo and Newton in this case.  Claiming `F` as evidence for `T'` in a domain not defined by `F` and `M` is pseudoscience. It does often happen that `D'` gets bigger as more evidence is collected, but sometimes a different theory is needed to expand the domain. Also, excluding `M` from the definition of the domain is dishonest.

>The only difference between such a measure and a more recent theory is age and familiarity. Had the younger theory been there first, then the consistency condition would have worked in its favour

Which is why the consistency condition used in this book is not used by scientists.  New theories are expected to be consistent with old evidence, but not necessarily with old theories. No scientist (except for perhaps a creationist or two) has ever claimed that Galileo's gravity is an argument against Newtonian gravity. Not in Newton's time and not since. 

The author claims in the foot note that "The consistency condition goes back to Aristotle at least. It plays an important pan in Newton's philosophy (though Newton himself constantly violated it)." Suggests that 1. Aristotle was wrong, and 2. Newton was not as swayed by that particular formulation of the principal as the author would have us believe. 

### Page 24

>It is well known (and has also been shown in detail by Duhem) that Newton's mechanics is inconsistent with Galileo's law of free fall and with Kepler's laws; that statistical thermodynamics is inconsistent with the second law of the phenomenological theory· that wave optics is inconsistent with geometrical optics; and so on. 1

The above quote shows a bizarre misunderstanding of science. Newtonian mechanics produces both Galileo's falling objects and Kepler's law. Newton just found a unified formula that fit both models. Since Newton's laws predict Galilean gravity and Kepler's laws, then evidence supporting either also support Newton's laws.  Newton also helped to refine the domain of the other two laws far more quickly than building better measuring devices. I.e. It found the limits of both, and therefore a new domain which excludes those laws years before sufficiently accurate measuring devices existed.

Similarly, statistical mechanics derives the second law of thermodynamics mathematically so that it can be taken as a statistical law (supported by substantial evidence) rather than an inductive assumption. I.e. It made thermodynamics more parsimonious and proved that the second law of thermodynamics would exist whether we assume it to or not.

The Duhem he refers seems to is [Pierre Duhem, The Aim and Structure of Physical Theory, New York, 1962, pp. 180 fT.](https://archive.org/details/AimStructure/page/n201)


I didn't see anything on or around the cited page to support the claims it is supposed to. The chapter is about avoiding the pitfall that Feyerabend seems to take as gospel.
