* The planet had been annexed 5 years earlier in a bloody war

	* ancillaries are "walking corpses, slaved to your ships' AIs"
	* the locals are more frightened by human soldiers because of their capacity and tendency for cruelty
* They discuss an incident at *Ime*
	> For years the governor of Ime used this distance to her own advantage--embezzling, ... Thousands of citizens had been unjustly executed or ... forced into service as ancillary bodies, even though the manufacture of ancillaries was no longer legal. The governor controlled all communications and travel permits, and normally a station ai would report such activity to the authorities, but Ime Station had somehow been prevented from doing so.
	Until a ship entered the system, came out of gate space only a few hundred kilometers from patrol ship Mercy of Sarrse. ... crew attacked and boarded it, they found dozens of humans, as well as the alien Rrrrrr... One Amaat One decided she wasnt willing to kill these people, or the Rrrrrr. And convinced the rest of her unit to follow her.

> "Radchaii have few qualms about killing humans, especially noncitizen humans, but you're very cautious about starting wars with aliens."
> Only because wars with aliens might run up against the terms of the treaty with the alien **Presger**
* 1 Amaat 1 may have already been executed for disobeying orders.

* Esk is after a rare Gardseddai artefact that Strigan likely received as payment for medical services years earlier.
* she has been running and hiding since.

### Ch. 04
* Lt Awn is conducting a religious ceremony in Ors
* The ship helps her read the oracles.
* Business contracts have to be conducted in (or on the steps of) a church of Amaat
* There are only a few temples of Amaat, the one in which Lt Awn works is semi-official
* The villagers have been suffering due to fishing restrictions
* Some local Ors reveal to Awn that they have found a weapons cache which they believe would have been used to frame them for crimes by ethnic Tanminds in the high City
* Later Awn attends a meeting with two prominent Tanminds: Jen Shinnan and her cousin.
	* They had moved into space before the annexation of their world, but maintained a presence in Ors as sort of a colonial power
	* A Lt Skaaiat from Justice of Ente, in command of Seven Issa, also attends the meeting
	* He provokes the Tanminds into making ever more racist remarks against the Ors because he finds Lt Awn's anger amusing
	* The Tanminds miss-interpret Awn's professionalism as interest
	* The initial complaint is that one of the Tanmind's entire crop was "confiscated." She was compensated, though not as much as she wanted.
	* Jen Shinnan believes that the Orsians are inferior because their houses are open and they have no privacy.
	* In the Tanmind religion, planets (Shis'urna) are the underworld, and space stations are a middle ground between that and "The Black," which is God's home.
	* After some time, the Radchii point out that there is even less privacy in space stations (thre Tanminds' preferred environment) due to constant AI monitoring.
	* Jen Shinnan blames the fishing restrictions on overfishing, though it was more likely the fact that she was having the area dredged for soil what was sold in space for religious uses, or as fertalizer.
	* The discussion moves on to the Assessments, which determine job opportunities in the Radch empire, and is required to join the military or civil service.
		* Since the annexation, only Orsians have scored well on the assessments. the Jens believe this is due to bias.
		* As the meeting ends, Awn and Skaaiat discuss the assessments.  Awn was not from a wealthy family, and is aware that the tests have been biased to favor the wealthy in the past.
		* In the present it may be that the Orsians are being rewarded for surrendering first.
	* The empire seems to be changing
		* More egalitarian assessments
		* Wars and ancilliaries have been prohibited.
		* They still have stokckpiles of corpses they can presumably use.
	* Skaaiat points out the parasitic how the parasitic nature of the high houses is recapitulated in the empire itself
	> You're born assuming that someone else is paying the cost of your life.  It's just the way things are.  What happens during annexation--it's a difference of degree, not a difference of kind.

### Ch. 05
