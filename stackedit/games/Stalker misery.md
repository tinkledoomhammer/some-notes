This is a bit small
This is better. I would go up to 30% if i could get rid of the address bar. Mightbe able to go smaller in landscape too.
```js
let a =100
```
So for now its 31 in portrait which seems like plenty. 30 in landscape is pretty tight but hopefully with practice i can shrink down the landscape keyboard incrementally.
