## Revised Spellup

Groups:
2-3x continual
1x emergency
1x mana/practice

Each has one marker effect
Continual: elemental shield
Emergency: night eye? light?
Mana/prac: 

Unspelled stats:
Stat | Unspelled | Needed
--|--|--
Shield | 50 | 50
Magic Resist | 90 | 10

Icon limit is 8, so which attributes get buffed should be limited.

3xElemental Shield, Fort Mag,  3xFort attr(?)

How many attributes do I want to fortify? Is 2 adequate? Will power is necessary (?) since it stacks so well with fortify magicka.  Int can be foregone since I want fortify magika on everything. Personality is pretty useless most of the time, and If i ever fortify it, it would be in a short-duration spell.
Endurance, Strength, Agility, Speed all seem somewhat usefull.
Luck - By default provides a 0.4x bonus to all skills. I.e. +10 luck will effectively increase all skills by 4. This seems way high, and I should probably use it even if it is nerfed. 
* Luck does not affect athletics or acrobatics :<


So that makes willpower and luck essential. Speed, etc would be nice, but I won't be able to keep my effect icons compact with it.
Each Continuous buff has:
* Fort Mag
* Fort Will
* Fort Luck

Affect | When Used
--|--
Fort Luck | All continuous buffs
Fort Magicka | (nearly) all
Fort Will | All continuous buffs
Fort Int | Only on the casting/mana buff
Shock Shield | Continuous buff 1
Fire Shield | continuous buff 2
Frost Shield | continuous buff 3
Shield | Emergency Buff
Resist Mag | Emergency Buff
Feather | Rarely. The cap will make it useless most of the time.


## Movement Speed
The following is how movement speed works in vanilla Oblivion:

Speed factor ranges from 0.9 (speed=0) to 1.3 (speed=100).
Athletics factor depends on movement type. For running it is 3+athl/100. This means that each point of athletics gives a marginal boots of 0.3% to overall running speed @athl=0, and 0.25%@athl=100.

Speed affects walking, running, and swimming, with marginal bonuses of 0.44%@spd=0 to 0.31%@spd=100.
