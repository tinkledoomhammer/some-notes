Items that are safe to sell

**It's 100% safe to sell all the items in the category 'Junk' and 'Valuables' except maybe for**:  

-   **Old World Coin**, which can be used to purchase food and beverages from the vending machines in The Hort.  
      
    
-   **Fine Dining Knife**  if you want to be able to upgrade shotguns.

  
Next, from all the above information, I drew the following conclusions for myself as to what other items are safe to sell. These are items you'll loot a ton of if you invest in the Animal Trophies skill, which I strongly advise you do if you want to become filthy rich in Elex.  

-   **Beak**,  **Pelt**,  **Ivory**,  **Raptorial Leg**  and  **Ivory Leg**  aren't used for crafting.  
      
    
-   **Claw**  is only used to make  **Serrated Bolt**  and  **Serrated Spear**, so if you're not playing Outlaw (or if you are but have no need for either serrated ammo), you can safely sell all the Claws you find.  
      
    
-   **Teeth**  are only used for crafting  **Piercing Spear**  and  **Warrior's Amulet**. So if you're not playing Outlaw (or if you are but have no need for those spears), you can either sell all the Teeth you find or just keep 12 of them if you intend to make the amulet.  
      
    
-   **Feather**,  **Wing**,  **Cyclop's Eye**,  **Ivory Plate**  and  **Troll Heart**  _(*)_  only seem to be used for Goldsmithing. Since I don't think Goldsmithing is worth it in this game, I sold all of these items.  
      
    _(*) As I mentioned above, someone claimed Troll Heart is used for weapon upgrading. I never encountered a weapon that required a Troll Heart to upgrade but I probably didn't check every single weapon in the game so to be on the safe side, you may want to hold on to your Troll Hearts._

  
You can draw other conclusions depending on your build.
